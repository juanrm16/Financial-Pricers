# Simple Financial Pricers (Python)

This mini-project contains three pricers:
- **Bond Pricer:** prices fixed-rate bonds using cashflow discounting.
- **Option Pricer:** implements the Blackâ€“Scholes model for European options.
- **Swap Pricer:** computes the fair fixed rate of a vanilla interest rate swap.

### Tech Stack
Python, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib

### What I learned
- How financial models translate into code
- Building reusable functions and running them from Terminal
- Visualizing price relationships in financial instruments
